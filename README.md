## Deployment

There is a `run.sh` script you can use to start the container.
Remember to replace your json instead of mine. \
Using `everything.exe` windows, you need to find `CustomLibs` the folder and change the babble host address.
If you have questions, then ask me on Discord or something. Otherwise, good luck lol

### Linux babble config location example
`/home/botlaplinux/.var/app/dfgHiatus.github.VRCFaceTracking.Avalonia/config/VRCFaceTracking/CustomLibs/360b014b-b57b-450f-8f12-9904618ff370/BabbleConfig.json`
This is where my config is located, when installed using flatpak.

## Requirements
- Linux
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [NVidia container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)

Idk if other architectures is supported, but contact me on Discord for help if you want.

## info
The Babble version used is before the License change and before progressive calibration.
